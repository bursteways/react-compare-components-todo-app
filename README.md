# React Components: Classes vs. Functional, Lifecycles & Hooks

**Slide deck**

- Class Components
    - Lifecycle Methods
- Functional
    - Hooks
- Comparing the two component types
    - Class component ⇒ object-oriented
    - Functional component ⇒ functional
        - *Why is this preferred?*
    - Reduction of overall code
        - Less to maintain
        - Easier to read
    - Performance
    - +1 for hooks: Reduced coupling
        - Improves modularity and reduces dependencies among other components
- Takeaway
    - Class components are not wrong, but the community is gravitating towards functional components
    - With Functional - we can use hooks as a community with React 16.8
    - Testability - easier to unit test
        - *Find an example*

**Live Coding** - shared repo of **TODO App** + TS

- **Class component**
    - Super
    - LifeCycleMethods
        - ComponentWillMount etc.
    - Methods
        - `this`
        - render
    - Props
- **Functional component**
    - Hooks
        - **useEffect**
            - Lifecycle methods
        - **useState**
        - **useRef**
        - *useReducer*
        - *useContext*

- No testing differences between the two
